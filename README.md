Checkout libraries and code on Simone's GitLab https://gitlab.com/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar
1.  Everyday Life : Conway's Game of Life - implemented from one of the many codebases in Github, controls for speed, refresh, brightness, and turn-off
2.  Everyday Tetris: Tetris implementation from an older project with movement, rotation, and drop.... this is very much in 'alpha' currently ;)
